This project performs a full statistical analysis of student academic performance using a dataset containing math, reading, and writing scores along with demographic and preparation-related attributes. The analysis examines how different factors—such as gender and participation in a test preparation course—are associated with variations in test scores.

The project includes:
- Distribution visualizations for different student groups
- Bayesian posterior simulations for estimating population parameters
- Comparative analyses showing credible intervals and differences between groups
