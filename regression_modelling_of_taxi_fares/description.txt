This program loads NYC Taxi trip data, prepares it for modeling, and trains a
linear regression model to estimate taxi fare amounts.

The workflow includes:
- reading the trip dataset
- converting timestamps
- computing trip duration
- handling outliers for duration and fare using the IQR method
- calculating mean distance and duration by pickup/dropoff pair
- extracting time-related features such as day, month, and rush hour
- preparing the dataset by removing unused fields
- splitting into training and testing sets
- scaling numerical features
- training a linear regression model
- evaluating the model on both training and test sets
- generating diagnostic plots
- predicting fares for the full dataset
- applying a fixed fare for trips where RatecodeID equals 2

All tasks are completed using common data analysis tools, following a
structured data preparation and modeling workflow.
